"Contact lounge at FRA airport crowded and poor choice of breakfast items. Boarding was well organized. Both flights in Mini Qsuite which I prefer over th Qsuite. Both flights on time and service was good. Al Safwa lounge in Doha good as usual. The big letdown was the food. Presentation and taste was not what I am used to and the quality of wine was reduced. WiFi not working, transfer gate system through the entertainment syste not working.","Contact   lounge   at   FRA   airport   crowded   and   poor   choice   of   breakfast   item s.

"My recent flights with Qatar helped remind me of what makes a truly world class airline. Cabin crew truly SERVE the passenger  every single passenger every single time. I watched it happen consistently across two flights over 16 hours with multiple crew and multiple passengers. No request is too much of an issue. I had the most incredible creamy chicken curry in economy that was better than any business class dish I have had the entertainment selection is brilliant and getting better and the baggage allowance to Africa flights 2 23kg keeps them with all the other competition. There was a medical emergency on the flight to London and they handled it as a team like consummate professionals. Combined with the incredible experience transiting through the lush faux rain forest of Hamad, Doha, Qatar is surely the best option. One big bugbear is the charging of seats even at online checkin  its cheap, miserly and unnecessary and none of the African carriers Rwandair Ethiopian or Kenyan on this route do this  but Emirates does so I guess its who they see as their competition. All else considered  Qatar well done  your crew, onboard overall service and transfer is world class.","My   recent   flights   with   Qatar   helped   remind   me   of   what   makes   a   truly   world   class   airline .

"Check in fast and friendly, contract Miracle lounge with poor breakfast offerings. Boarding rather unorganised. Mini Qsuite on the 789 very private and comfortable. Service friendly and efficient.

"I want to sincerely thank Qatar Airways for their incredible kindness during a very difficult moment. While checking in at Jeddah Airport, I couldn’t afford the extra baggage fees. The supervisor and assistant at the counter showed me compassion I’ll never forget — they allowed me the extra baggage allowance without charging me anything.  This experience showed me that Qatar Airways is not only a worldclass airline but also one that truly cares about its passengers beyond business. Because of this, I will remain a loyal customer.","I   want   to   sincerely   thank   Qatar   Airways   for   their   incredible   kindness   during   a   very   difficult   moment .

"Boarding was efficient, friendly, personable welcome by cabin crew. Preflight drink offered quickly, guidance given on screen and seat operation. Meal orders taken dine on demand. What a comfy seat that turned into one of the best lie flat beds Ive had in the sky. The attentive service from our dedicated crew member was outstanding. The quality and quantity of the food and beverages were well beyond my expectations. The luxurious inflight bar and lounge was, well, luxurious and a wonderful place to meet fellow travellers. Naturally the mandatory photo standing behind the bar was necessary. For a 15 hour nonstop flight, I was more than impressed with this Airline. No need for a QSuite, the A380 business class seat is far better in my view. Well done Qatar Airways, I will definitely fly QR again.","Boarding   was   efficient ,  friendly ,  personable   welcome   by   cabin   crew .

"I was scheduled to travel from Johannesburg JHB to Doha DOH and onward to Vienna VIE on 14 August 2025. Upon arrival at the checkin counter, three different agents attempted to process my checkin but appeared uncertain, repeatedly consulting a Team Leader. Despite having a visa, valid ticket, and all required supporting documents, I was eventually asked to stand aside. As delays continued, the manager instructed the ground staff to close the gate, ultimately causing me to miss my flight. This delay and lack of proper handling were due to the inefficiency of the ground staff. Following this incident, I approached KLM to book an alternative route. Their staff reviewed my documents and could not understand why Qatar Airways had denied me boarding, as my documentation was in order. I returned to the Qatar Airways counter later that day. At this point, the staff had changed, and I was asked to present my documents again. This was the first time that a staff member took photographs of my documents and sent them to Vienna for verification. The duty manager confirmed there was nothing wrong with my documents and stated that I could board provided I contacted the call centre to amend my ticket. I spoke with four different agents, but calls repeatedly dropped, and none of the agents who promised to call back actually did. The final call centre representative I spoke to quoted ZAR 17,000 to rebook my ticket. I do not accept that I should be liable for this cost. I have since boarded a Kenya Airways flight to Vienna via Nairobi and Amsterdam without a complication or request for additional documents. This demonstrates that my paperwork was correct and the initial refusal by Qatar Airways was unjustified.","I   was   scheduled   to   travel   from   Johannesburg   J HB   to   Doha   DOH   and   onward   to   Vienna   VIE   on  14  August   2 0 2 5.

"Doha to Copenhagen in Business Class. There is a reason Qatar Airways remains at the top exceptional comfort in both hard and soft product.

"Flying Business Class with Qatar Airways was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I boarded, I was impressed by the attention to detail and the warm welcome from the cabin crew. They were genuinely helpful, attentive without being intrusive, and went out of their way to ensure I was comfortable throughout the flight. What really made the experience memorable was the professionalism and kindness of the crew. Whether it was offering assistance with the seat settings, adjusting lighting, or just checking in regularly with a smile, their service felt personal and sincere.

"Having arrived in Doha at 6.00am with my family including my wife and two small children from Melbourne, we were due to have a 3h 30m stopover in Doha before boarding a flight to Venice. The scheduled flight for 9.30am was delayed, with a new departure time set for 13.00. Great experience for our young sleep deprived kids 4yo  2yo. Upon boarding the delayed flight and having commenced taxiing the runway, the captain advised that due to a technical issue, we were required to return to the gate to await further engineer inspection. Having waited almost two hours for further information and grappling with our young children who were losing it by now, we were then advised that we must disembark the plane and return to the terminal, with a revised scheduled departure time of 18.00. This revised departure time meant that we would land in Venice at 22.20, which left us unable to make a connecting train to Trieste where we had accommodation booked for the evening. I had to book emergency accommodation in Venice for 1 night and forego the booked accommodation in Trieste. On the delayed flight, they even charged me to use the Wifi so that I could confirm our accommodation  typically an experience expected on a budget low cost airline. We did not arrive to our accommodation in Venice until after midnight and were almost left stranded as we couldnt communicate with the host who was about to depart from the accom. We lost a day of our holiday due to this delay, along with the incurred expense of booking emergency accommodation and loss of booked accommodation, due to the 8h 30m delay at Doha airport. Im very disappointed in the qualty of service and the mental impact this had on my family at the start of a dream holiday. Indeed, an awful experience to have to endure with no word of apology or possible compensation from Qatar Airways. A bang average airline dressed up as the best in the world. Laughable. Will never book with them again.","Having   arrived   in   Doha   at  6.00 am   with   my   family   including   my   wife   and   two   small   children   from   Melbourne ,  we   were   due   to   have   a  3 h  30 m   stopover   in   Doha   before   boarding   a   flight   to   Venice .

Having   waited   almost   two   hours   for   further   information   and   grappling   with   our   young   children   who   were   losing   it   by   now ,  we   were   then   advised   that   we   must   disembark   the   plane   and   return   to   the   terminal ,  with   a   revised   scheduled   departure   time   of  18.00.  This   revised   departure   time   meant   that   we   would   land   in   Venice   at   2 2 . 2 0,  which   left   us   unable   to   make   a   connecting   train   to   Trieste   where   we   had   accommodation   booked   for   the   evening .  I   had   to   book   emergency   accommodation   in   Venice   for  1  night   and   forego   the   booked   accommodation   in   Trieste .  On   the   delayed   flight ,  they   even   charged   me   to   use   the   Wi fi   so   that   I   could   confirm   our   accommodation    typically   an   experience   expected   on   a   budget   low   cost   airline .  We   did   not   arrive   to   our   accommodation   in   Venice   until   after   midnight   and   were   almost   left   stranded   as   we   couldnt   communicate   with   the   host   who   was   about   to   depart   from   the   ac com.   We   lost   a   day   of   our   holiday   due   to   this   delay ,  along   with   the   incurred   expense   of   booking   emergency   accommodation   and   loss   of   booked   accommodation ,  due   to   the  8 h  30 m   delay   at   Doha   airport .  Im   very   disappointed   in   the   qual ty   of   service   and   the   mental   impact   this   had   on   my   family   at   the   start   of   a   dream   holiday .  Indeed ,  an   awful   experience   to   have   to   endure   with   no   word   of   apology   or   possible   compensation   from   Qatar   Airways .  A   bang   average   airline   dressed   up   as   the   best   in   the   worl d.   Laughable .  Will   never   book   with   them   again ."
"Its been a while since I flew Qatar Airways and I had forgotten how good it can be. Lounge at Heathrow provided a fabulous a la carte lunch, and the onboard dining was great for airline meals. Staff were very attentive and polite, and the Qsuite is unbeatable. Ive used Emirates and BA on some recent trips and theyre simply not close to Qatar. 5 Star at its best.","Its   been   a   while   since   I   flew   Qatar   Airways   and   I   had   forgotten   how   good   it   can   b e.

Friendly staff assisted with swift baggage drop and clear instructions. Boarding was timely and stressfree, with dedicated lanes for different classes and priority passengers.

Adjustable headrests, a plush seat cushion, and a thoughtfully designed tray table added to the inflight ease. The inflight meals were restaurantquality.
